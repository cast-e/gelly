# Shaders

This directory contains the [SHADERed](https://shadered.org) project used for fast prototyping of shaders.
The shaders are shared with the Gelly renderer.

## SHADERed project

The SHADERed project contains a pretty good replication of the real Gelly renderer's inputs and outputs, making
prototyping much easier. To open the project, open `FluidRendering.sprj` in SHADERed.
